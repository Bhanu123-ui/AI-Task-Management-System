Project 1: Al-Powered Task Management System

Overview : 

Problem Statement  :   Design and develop an intelligent system that leverages NLP and ML automatically classify, prioritize, and assign tasks to users based on their behavior, deadlines, and workloads.


Week-wise Plan 


Week 1  : 
Collect datasets related to tasks (e.g., Trello, Jira APIs, synthetic task datasets).
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clean data.
Apply NLP preprocessing on task descriptions (tokenization, stemming, stopword, removal)


Week 2 : 
Feature extraction using TF-IDF/word embeddings (Word2Vee/BERT).
Implement task classification using Naive Bayes and SVM.
Set up version control with GitHub.
Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall.




Mid project review ( end of week 2 )  : 

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
 Task classifier (Naive Bayes/SVM) trained and evaluated
EDA visualizations completed


Week 3 : 
Implement priority prediction model using Random Forest/XGBoost. 
Integrate workload balancing logic using heuristic or ML approach.
Apply GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.


Week 4 : 
Finalize models for task classification and priority prediction.
Prepare dashboard mockup or output summary.
Compile performance metrics, graphs, and results.


Final project review ( end of week 4 ) : : 
Models finalized for task classification & prioritization
Summary dashboard / mockup created 
Final report prepared
